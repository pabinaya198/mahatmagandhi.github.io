        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869 in Porbandar, India. He became one of the most respected spiritual and political leaders of the 1900's. Gandhi helped free the Indian people from British rule through nonviolent resistance, and is honoured by Indians as the father of the Indian Nation.</p>
        <p>He was highly influenced by Thoreau, Tolstoy, Ruskin, and above all the life of Jesus Christ. The Bible, precisely the Sermon of the Mount and the Bagavad -Gita had a great influence on him. The Indian people called Gandhi 'Mahatma', meaning Great Soul. At the age of 13 Gandhi married Kasturba, a girl the same age. Their parents arranged the marriage. The Gandhis had four children. Gandhi studied law in London and returned to India in 1891 to practice. In 1893 he took on a one-year contract to do legal work in South Africa.</p>
        <p>At the time the British controlled South Africa (though South Africa as such did not exist at that time, and the British did not control all of it by any means. In fact the Boer War (1898-1900) established the supremacy of the British over the Dutch (Boers) and eventually led to the Union of South Africa. Gandhi served as a medical attendant in this war.). When he attempted to claim his rights as a British subject he was abused, and soon saw that all Indians suffered similar treatment. Gandhi stayed in South Africa for 21 years working to secure rights for Indian people. He developed a method of action based upon the principles of courage, non-violence and truth called Satyagraha. He believed that the way people behave is more important than what they achieve. Satyagraha promoted nonviolence and civil disobedience as the most appropriate methods for obtaining political and social goals. In 1915 Gandhi returned to India. Within 15 years he became the leader of the Indian nationalist movement.</p>
        <p>On January 13, 1948, at the age of 78, he began a fast with the purpose of stopping the bloodshed. After 5 days the opposing leaders pledged to stop the fighting and Gandhi broke his fast. Twelve days later a Hindu fanatic, Nathuram Godse who opposed his programme of tolerance for all creeds and religion assassinated him.</p>
        <p>There are five great contributions which Mahatma Gandhi gave to the world as follows: (1)A New spirit and technique- Satyagraha; (2) The Emphasis that the moral universe is one and that the morals of individuals, groups, and nations must be the same. (3)His insistence that the means and the ends must be consistent; (4) The fact that he held no ideals he did not embody or was not in the process of embodying. (5) A willingness to suffer and die for his principles. The greatest of these is his Satyagraha</p>
        
        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi was a national and human rights activist who served during the twentieth century. He worked as a lawyer, politician, and activist in the battle for social and economic justice and India’s liberation from British control. Mahatma is known worldwide for his peaceful protest (Satyagraha) philosophy of achieving social and political development.</p>
        <P class="underline">Champaran Satyagraha:</P>
        <p>1917, Gandhi’s first significant accomplishment was the Champaran agitation in Bihar. The Champaran movement opposed local peasants against their mostly British proprietors, supported by the local government. Indigofera, a cash crop, was pressed onto the peasantry. Indigo dye’s market had been shrinking for two decades, and they were compelled to dispose of their stocks. Planters are paid a set price for their produce. Unsatisfied, the peasantry turned to Gandhi for help. Ahmedabad has an ashram. Gandhi, pursuing a peaceful protest method, overtook the government. Regulators were taken aback and made concessions as a result of the surprise.</p>
        <p class="underline">Kheda Satyagraha:</p>
        <p>flood and starvation struck Kheda in 1918, prompting the peasantry to seek tax relief. Gandhi established his headquarters at Nadiad, enlisting the help of many followers and new workers from the area, the most important of whom was Vallabhbhai Patel. Gandhi began a signature drive using non-cooperation as a tactic, in which peasants vowed non-payment of tribute even under the threat of seizure of land. A social boycott supported the movement by mamlatdars and talatdars (district tax authorities). Gandhi fought tirelessly to gain broad public support for the struggle. The cabinet resisted for five months, but in late May 1918, the government ultimately caved in and reduced the taxation payment conditions until the catastrophe was over.</p>
        <p class="underline">Non-Cooperation movement:</p>
        <p>Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred on April 13th, 1919, when British forces closed the sole entrance to Jallianwala Bagh and then started shooting at a gathering of nonviolent demonstrators slaughtering around 1,000 people. In reaction, Gandhi launched the Non-cooperation movement. He urged Indians to boycott British-made goods, boycott their academic institutions and judiciary, withdraw from government positions, and forego British honors and awards, among other things. The non-cooperation campaign was well-liked and effective. An enraged Indian crowd set a British police headquarters on fire in February 1922, killing 22 people, due to three demonstrators being slain by police. After the event, Gandhi called a halt to the march, afraid it might devolve into violence.</p>
        <p class="underline">Dandi March:</p>
        <p>The British Salt Act of 1882 made it illegal for Indians to gather or sell salt and imposed a high tax. From March 12th to April 6th, 1930, Mahatma Gandhi walked 388 kilometers from Ahmedabad to Dandi, Gujarat, to make salt from saltwater, as the local population had done before the British Salt Policy. This legendary Salt March, or Dandi March, drew tens of thousands of Indians. It provoked widespread nonviolent protest towards British salt rules by millions of Indians, resulting in the imprisonment of 80,000 Indians. Even though it did not result in any agreements, the Salt March was mentioned in the press, and the world started to see the Indian claim to freedom as legitimate.</p>
        <p class="underline">Quit India Movement:</p>
        <p> the outbreak of World War II, Gandhi argued that India couldn’t have been a party to a war ostensibly waged for democratic rights. At the same time, that independence was forbidden to India. On August 8th, 1942, he began the Quit India Movement, which demanded an end to British rule in India. In his Quit India address, he urged people to “Do or Die.” Within hours following his statement, almost the top leadership of the Indian National Congress was arrested without charge. Massive rallies and protests were staged around the country despite a lack of coordination. Over 100,000 people were arrested by the British, and hundreds were slain. Even though the British successfully suppressed the Quit India Campaign, they understood it was no longer feasible to dominate India.</p>
